# LinuxTyper

The superior Auto-Typer for Linux.

## Features

LinuxTyper is a productivity tool written in C that automates repetitive typing tasks at specified intervals in a selected window. The GUI is built with GTK, allowing it to integrate smoothly with most Linux desktops.

Users can **input a desired time** in seconds and **up to five different phrases**, then **select a window** by clicking on it. At the specified time interval **Linuxtyper chooses a random phrase and types it into the selected window**.
        
While other auto-typers require users to keep the cursor on the selected window, **LinuxTyper can run in the background. Even if the selected window is minimized**, LinuxTyper will automatically maximize it to execute the routine and then minimize it again.

LinuxTyper **remembers previously used phrases** the next time the app is opened.
